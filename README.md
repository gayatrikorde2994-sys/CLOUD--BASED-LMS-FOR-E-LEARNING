Title: CLOUD-BASED LMS FOR E-LEARNING

Authors: N. Angelova, G. Kiryakova, L. Yordanova

Publication: Trakia Journal of Sciences, Vol. 13, Suppl. 1, 2015

Domain: Cloud Computing and E-Learning Systems

2. Description of Research Paper
This research paper evaluates and compares various cloud-based Learning Management Systems (LMS) such as TalentLMS, Litmos, and Haiku LMS.

It focuses on how these platforms manage educational content and administrative tools via web interfaces.

The paper highlights essential features like web conferencing, automated attendance management, and interactive course building tools.

3. Implementation Overview (Outputs)
The goal of this project was to replicate the output screens presented in the research paper using HTML and CSS. I have developed the following three interfaces:

Conference Interface (index.html): Replicates Figure 1 (TalentLMS), featuring a user status table (Status, Name, Media), a whiteboard presentation area, and a real-time chat panel.

Course Builder (analysis.html): Replicates Figure 2 (Litmos LMS), implementing the "Informatika" course creation dashboard with a dark-themed tool grid including Assessment, Survey, and User Checklist.

Attendance System (attendance.html): Replicates Figure 3 (Haiku LMS), focusing on the "New Attendance Book" setup form with active field highlighting (yellow background) and notation settings.

4. Tools & Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for creating the semantic structure and layout components like tables and forms.

CSS3: Utilized for custom styling, dark-themed panels, and precise color matching to the paper's figures.

CSS Grid & Flexbox: Employed to handle complex multi-pane layouts and tool grids accurately.

GitHub: Used for version control and project repository preparation as per Step 4 instructions.

VS Code: The primary code editor used for development.

5. Repository Structure
As per Step 3 and 4 of the instructions, the project is organized as follows:

index.html: Implementation of the Conference Interface.

analysis.html: Implementation of the Course Builder Interface.

attendance.html: Implementation of the Attendance Form.

style.css: Unified CSS file containing styles for all pages.
